Plan of work:
 - Extract different characteriscs of the text with Bag Of Words, TF-IDF and Word2Vec. For the model use both unsupervised and supervised methods.
 - For the supervised methods  use the MLPCLassifier and for the unsupervised KMeans.
 - Analyze the results from each version and documented them.
